# The Impact of the 2014-2016 Russian Financial Crisis on Remittances, Consumption, and Credit: The Case of Kyrgyzstan

What is the impact of an exogenous shock to the Russian economy on welfare outcomes for remittance-receiving households in Central Asia? 

In this paper submitted as a master thesis for the program in International Trade, Finance, and Development at the Barcelona School of Economics in 2022, we consider the medium-term impact of the Russian Financial Crisis of 2014-2016 on remittances, consumption patterns, and credit in the Kyrgyz Republic. 

Using panel data from the Life in Kyrgyzstan survey and employing a difference-in- difference approach, we show a significant drop in migration to Russia and remittances from Russia on the extensive and intensive margins. 

We demonstrate that households with a migrant abroad in Russia just prior to the crisis experience an average fall in real per capita income and an increase in poverty. All households with and without a migrant experience an increase in food share expenditure and decrease in leisure expenditure, consistent with a re-balancing of the consumption basket during an economic downturn. Households with migrants still in Russia but no longer sending remittances are more likely to apply for a loan and less likely to save after the crisis. Our paper contributes to the literature by demonstrating a negative medium term impact of the Russian Financial Crisis on Kyrgyz families and families of migrants in particular, though these households are resilient to this transitory shock. Our results suggest that the current conflict in Ukraine and the associated negative shock to the Russian economy is likely to have a similar impact on closely-linked Central Asian economies.
